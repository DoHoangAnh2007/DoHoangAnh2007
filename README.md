# Hi there. Welcome to my Profile! ðŸ‘‹

Nice to meet you. I'm Hoang Anh, a student currently studying English Language and Literature at a high school in Vietnam.

Currently, I am interested in Machine Learning. I also love tinkering with software and contributing to open-source projects. Competitive Programming is my hobby.

You have to trust in something - your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.
